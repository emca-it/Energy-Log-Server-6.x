Energy Log Server project was created to centralize events of all IT
areas in the organization. We focused on creating a tool that
functionality is most expected by IT departments. Because an effective
licensing model has been applied, the solution can be implemented in
the scope expected by the customer even with very large volume of
data. At the same time, the innovation architecture allows for
servicing a large portion of data, which cannot be dedicated to
solution with limited scalability.
