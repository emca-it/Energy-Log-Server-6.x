# Kibana #

Kibana lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack. Kibana gives you the freedom to select the way you give
shape to your data. And you donâ€™t always have to know what you're looking for. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line
graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. Plus, you can use Vega grammar to design your own visualizations. All leverage the full
aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.  Perform advanced time series analysis on your Elasticsearch data with our curated time series
UIs. Describe queries, transformations, and visualizations with powerful, easy-to-learn expressions. Kibana 6.x has two new feature - a new "Full-screen" mode to viewing dashboards, and new the "Dashboard-only" mode which enables administrators to share dashboards safely.
