# Saving and deleting queries #


Saving queries enables you to reload and use them in the future. 

## Save query ##
To save query, click on the "Save" button under on the query bar:

![](/media/media/image16.png) 

This will bring up a window in which we give the query a name and then
click the button ![](/media/media/image17.png).

![](/media/media/image18_js.png)

Saved queries can be opened by going to â€žOpen" from the main menu
at the top of the page, and select saved search from the search list:

![](/media/media/image19.png)

Additional you can use "Saved Searchers Filter.." to filter the search list.

## Open query ##
To open a saved query from the search list, you can click on the name of the query 
you are interested in.

After clicking on the icon 
![](/media/media/image21.png) on the name of the saved query and chose 
"Edit Query DSL", we will gain access to the advanced editing mode, 
so that we can change the query on at a lower level. 

![](/media/media/image21.png)

It is a powerful tool designed for advanced users, designed to modify 
the query and the way it is presented by Energy Log Server.

## Delete query ##
To delete a saved query, open it from the search list, and
then click on the button ![](/media/media/image23.png) . 

If you want delete many saved queries simultaneously go to the "Management Object"
 -> "Saved Object" -> "Searches" select it in the list (the icon ![](/media/media/image22.png) 
to the left of the query name), and then click "Delete" button. 

![](/media/media/image24_js.png)

From this level, you can also export saved queries in the same way. To
do this, you need to click on
![](/media/media/image25.png) and choose the save location. The file
will be saved in .JSON format. If you then want to import such a file to
Energy Log Server, click on button
![](/media/media/image26.png), at the top of the page and select the
desired file.
