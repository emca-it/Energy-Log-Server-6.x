# Visualizations #


Visualize enables you to create visualizations of the data
in your Energy Log Server indices. You can then build dashboards
that display related visualizations. Visualizations are based
on Energy Log Server queries. By using a series of Energy Log Server
aggregations to extract and process your data, you can create
charts that show you the trends, spikes, and dips.
