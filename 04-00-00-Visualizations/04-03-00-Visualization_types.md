# Vizualization types #

Before the data visualization will be created, first you have to
choose the presentation method from an existing list. Currently there
are five groups of visualization types. Each of them serves different purposes.
If you want to see only the current number of products
sold, it is best to choose „Metric", which presents one value.

However, if we would like to see user activity trends on pages in
different hour and days, a better choice will be „Area chart", which
displays a chart with time division.

The „Markdown widget" views is used to place text e.g. information
about the dashboard, explanations and instruction on how to navigate.
Markdown language was used to format the text (the most popular use is
GitHub).
