# Dashboards #


Dashboard is a collection of several visualizations or searches.
Depending on how it is build and what visualization it contains, it
can be designed for different teams e.g.: 
- SOC - which is responsible for detecting failures or threats in 
the company; 
- business - which thanks to the listings can determine the popularity
of products and define the strategy of future sales and promotions; 
- managers and directors - who may immediately have access to information
about the performance units or branches. 

## Create ##
To create a dashboard from previously saved visualization and queries,
go to the â€žDashboard" tab in the main menu. When you open it, a
new page will appear.

![](/media/media/image32.png)

Clicking on the icon "Add" at the top of page select "Visualization" or "Saved Search"
tab.

![](/media/media/image32_js.png)

and selecting a saved query and / or visualization from the list will 
add them to the dashboard. If, there are a large number of saved objects, 
use the bar to search for them by name. 

Elements of the dashboard can be enlarged arbitrarily (by clicking on
the right bottom corner of object and dragging the border) and moving
(by clicking on the title bar of the object and moving it). 

## Saving ##
To save a dashboard, click on the "Save" button to the up of the query bar 
and give it a name. 

## Load ##
To load the Dashboard, go to the "Management Object"
 -> "Saved Object" -> "Dashborad" select it in the list. From this place, 
we can also go into advanced editing mode. To view of the visualization 
use ![](/media/media/image17_1_js.png) button.
