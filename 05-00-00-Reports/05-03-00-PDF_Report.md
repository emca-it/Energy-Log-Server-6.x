# PDF Report #

In the Export Dashboard tab we have the possibility to create
graphic reports in PDF files. 
To create such a report, just from the drop-down list of previously 
created and saved Dashboards, indicate the one we are interested in, 
and then confirm the selection with the Submit button. A newly 
created export with the Processing status will appear on the list 
under Dashboard Name. 
When the processing is completed, the Status changes to Complete and it
will be possible to download the report.

or we can open it in the PDF file browser. There is also to option
of deleting the report with the Delete button.
