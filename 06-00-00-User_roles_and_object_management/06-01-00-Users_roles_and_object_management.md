A new window will appear with three main tabs: „User Management",
„Settings" and „License Info".

From the „User Management" level we have access to the following
possibilities: Creating a user in „Create User", displaying users in
„User List", creating new roles in „Create roles" and displaying
existing roles in „List Role".
