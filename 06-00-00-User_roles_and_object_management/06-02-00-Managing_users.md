# Creating a User (Create User) #

## Creating user ##
To create a new user click on the Config icon and you immediately
enter the administration panel, where the first tab is to create
a new user (**Create User**).

In the wizard that opens, we enter a unique username (Username field),
password for the user (field Password) and assign a role (field Role). 
In this field we have the option of assigning more than one role. 
Until we select role in the Roles field, the Default Role field 
remains empty. When we mark several roles, these roles appear in 
the Default Role field. In this field we have the opportunity to 
indicate which role for a new user will be the default role with 
which the user will be associated in the first place when logging in. 
The default role field has one more important task - it binds all 
users with the field / role set in one group. When one of the users 
of this group create Visualization or Dashboard it will be available 
to other users from this role(group). Creating the account is confirmed 
with the Submit button.

## User's modification and deletion, (User List) ##

Once we have created users, we can display their list. We do it in
next tab (**User List**).

In this view, we get a list of user account with assigned roles and we
have two buttons: Delete and Update. The first of these is ability to
delete a user account. Under the Update button is a drop-down menu in
which we can change the previous password to a new one (New password),
change the password (Re-enter Ne Password), change the previously
assigned roles (Roles), to other (we can take the role assigned
earlier and give a new one, extend user permissions with new roles).
The introduced changes are confirmed with the Submit button.

We can also see current user setting and clicking the Update button 
collapses the previously expanded menu.
