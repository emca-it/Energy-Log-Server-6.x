# Alert Module #

Energy Log Server allows you to create alerts, i.e. monitoring
queries. These are constant queries that run in the background and
when the conditions specified in the alert are met, the specify action
is taken.

For example, if you want to know when more than 20
„status:500" responscode from on our homepage appear within an one
hour, then we create an alert that check the number of occurrences of
the „status:500" query for a specific index every 5 minutes. If the
condition we are interested in is met, we send an action in the form
of sending a message to our e-mail address. In the action, you can
also set the launch of any script.
