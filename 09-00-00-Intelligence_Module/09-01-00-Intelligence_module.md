# Intelligence Module #

A dedicated artificial intelligence module has been built in the 
Energy Log Server system that allows prediction of parameter values
relevant to the maintenance of infrastructure and IT systems. Such
parameters include:

- use of disk resources,
- use of network resources,
- using the power of processors
- detection of known incorrect behaviour of IT systems

In the future, it is planned to launch algorithms that enable
automatic detection of anomalies, e.g. non-standard network traffic,
which may suggest hacking attempts.

(A detailed description of the implemented algorithms can be found in
a separate document)

To access of the Intelligence module, click the tile icon
from the main meu bar and then go to the „Intelligence" icon (To go
back, click to the „Search" icon).

There are 4 screens available in the
module:![](/media/media/image64.png)

- **Create AI Rule** - the screen allows you to create artificial
     intelligence rules and run them in scheduler mode or immediately
- **AI Rules List** - the screen presents a list of created artificial
     intelligence rules with the option of editing, previewing and
     deleting them
- **AI Learn** - the screen allows to define the conditions for teaching
     the MLP neural network
- **AI Learn Tasks** - a screen on which the initiated and completed
     learning processes of neural networks with the ability to preview
     learning results are presented.
