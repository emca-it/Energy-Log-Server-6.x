Description of the controls available on the fixed part of screen:

- **Algorithm** - the name of the algorithm that forms the basis of the
artificial intelligence rule
- **Choose search** - search defined in the Energy Log Server system,
which is used to select a set of data on which the artificial
intelligence rule will operate
