# Results of algorithms #

The results of the "AI algorithms" are saved to the index â€žintelligence" specially created
for this purpose. The index with the prediction result. These
following fields are available in the index (where xxx is the name of
the attribute being analyzed):

-   **xxx\_pre** - estimate value
-   **xxx\_cur** - current value at the moment of estimation
-   **method\_name** - name of the algorithm used
-   **rmse** - avarage square error for the analysis in which \_cur values
     were available. **The smaller the value, the better.**
-   **rmse\_normalized** - mean square error for the analysis in which
     \_cur values were available, normalized with \_pre values. **The
     smaller the value, the better.**
-   **overall\_efficiency** - efficiency of the model. **The greater the
     value, the better. A value less than 0 may indicate too little
     data to correctly calculate the indicator**
-   **linear\_function\_a** - directional coefficient of the linear
     function y = ax + b. **Only for the Trend and Linear Regression
     Trend algorithm**
-   **linear\_function\_b** - the intersection of the line with the Y axis
     for the linear function y = ax + b. **Only for the Trend and
     Linear Regression Trend algorithm.**

Visualization and signals related to the results of data analysis
should be created from this index. The index should be available to
users of the Intelligence module.
