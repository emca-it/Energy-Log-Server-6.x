# Permission #

Permission have been implemented in the following way:

- Only the user in the admin role can create / update rules.
- When creating rules, the roles that will be able to enables /
  disengage / view the rules will be indicated.

We assume that the Learn process works as an administrator.

We assume that the visibility of Search in AI Learn is preceded by
receiving the search permission in the module object permission.

The role of "Intelligence" launches the appropriate tabs.

An ordinary user only sees his models. The administrator sees all
models.
