Give the name a certificate

![](/media/media/image84.png)

After the certificate is exported, this certificate should be imported
into a trusted certificate file that will be used by the Elasticsearch
plugin.

To import a certificate into a trusted certificate file, a tool called
â€žkeytool.exe" is located in the JDK installation directory.

Use the following command to import a certificate file:

	keytool -import -alias adding_certificate_keystore -file certificate.cer -keystore certificatestore
The values for RED should be changed accordingly.

By doing this, he will ask you to set a password for the trusted
certificate store. Remember this password, because it must be set in
the configuration of the Elasticsearch plugin. The following settings
must be set in the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration for
SSL:

	ssl.keystore.file: "<path to the trust certificate store>"
	ssl.keystore.password: "< password to the trust certificate store>"
